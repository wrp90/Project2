# Vaccination Tracker

We are looking to take input from users that includes their contact information and vaccination records. The text is overlayed on a digitial card to be a supplement to a physical card. This information can also be used to create analytics showing how many people in an area have the vaccination, how many have received their first/second dose, etc.
